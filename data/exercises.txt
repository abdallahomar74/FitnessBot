Push-up – A classic bodyweight exercise targeting the chest (pectoralis major and minor) along with the
triceps, anterior shoulder (deltoids), and core muscles . To perform, start in a high plank position
with hands shoulder-width apart and body in a straight line. Bend your elbows to lower your chest
toward the floor until it nearly touches, then push back up by extending your arms, keeping your core
tight and back flat . This compound movement builds upper-body and core strength when done with
proper form.
Plank – A static core exercise that engages the entire body. It targets the abdominal muscles (rectus
abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis) and lower back, while the shoulders, chest, quadriceps, and
glute muscles also work to stabilize the position . To do a plank, lie face-down and then lift onto
your forearms and toes, forming a straight line from head to heels . Keep your neck neutral and
engage your core and glutes to prevent hips from sagging or rising . Holding this position with
steady breathing builds core and shoulder endurance.
Bodyweight Squat – A lower-body exercise that primarily works the quadriceps, gluteal (buttock), and
hamstring muscles, with support from the hips and core . Stand with feet about shoulder-width
apart, brace your core, and push your hips back as you bend your knees to lower your body (as if sitting
back onto a chair) until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor . Keep your chest lifted and spine
neutral throughout. Press through your heels to return to standing while keeping your core engaged
. This movement strengthens the legs and glutes and improves balance.
Lunge – A unilateral leg exercise targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glute muscles on the front
leg, with the core and lower back stabilizing the movement . From a standing start, step one foot
forward and lower into a lunge by bending both knees until your front thigh is parallel to the floor (front
knee bent ~90°) and back knee hovers above the ground . Keep your torso upright and gaze
forward. Then push through the heel of the front foot to return to standing. Repeat on the other side.
This exercise builds leg strength and balance.
Pull-Up – A vertical pulling bodyweight exercise that primarily works the back muscles (latissimus dorsi)
and also engages the biceps, forearms, shoulders, and core . To perform a pull-up, grip an overhead
bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width and hang with arms fully extended. Pull your body
upward by bending your elbows until your chin clears the bar, keeping your chest up and shoulders
down. Lower yourself back to a full hang with control to complete one rep . Proper form develops
upper-body pulling strength and core stability.
Dip – A bodyweight pushing exercise focusing on the triceps (back of the upper arms), while also
engaging the chest (pectorals) and shoulders . Support yourself on parallel bars or the edge of a
bench with arms straight and shoulders above the hands. Bend your elbows to lower your body until
your shoulders dip below elbows (about a 90° bend), keeping the torso upright. Then push back up by
straightening the arms, using the triceps to lift your body. Maintain tight shoulders and a straight back
to protect the joints .
Sit-up – A traditional abdominal exercise that targets the rectus abdominis and other core muscles
(transverse abdominis, obliques) while also engaging the hip flexors and lower back stabilizers . Lie
on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands behind your head or crossed
on your chest, then exhale and curl your upper body toward your thighs by contracting the abs .
Keep your lower back pressed into the floor as you lift. Slowly lower back down under control. This
movement builds core strength through a full range of spine motion .
Bench Press – A key weightlifting exercise that primarily works the chest muscles (pectoralis major) and
also targets the anterior shoulders (front deltoids) and triceps . Lie on a bench with a barbell (or
dumbbells) at chest level, grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Press the weight upward by
extending your arms until they are nearly straight above you, then lower the weight back to chest level
under control . Keep your feet planted, back slightly arched, and shoulder blades retracted. This
compound move builds upper-body pushing strength .
Deadlift – A full-body weightlifting lift that targets the posterior chain: the hamstrings, glutes (buttocks),
and lower back (erector spinae), while also engaging the core, traps, and forearms . Stand with feet
hip-width under a barbell. Keeping your back flat and chest up, hinge at the hips and bend your knees
to grip the bar (mixed or double overhand grip) . Then drive through your heels and hips to lift the
bar, straightening your legs and torso to stand up tall. Reverse the motion to lower the bar to the
ground under control, keeping a neutral spine throughout .
Barbell Squat – A foundational leg exercise that works the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, and also
requires core and lower-back stability . Place a barbell across your upper back and stand with feet
shoulder-width apart. Brace your core and push your hips back as you bend your knees to lower into a
squat (as with a bodyweight squat) until your thighs are parallel to the floor . Keep your chest up and
spine neutral, then press through your heels to stand back up. This heavy compound movement builds
strength in the legs, hips, and core .
Overhead Press – A shoulder press exercise targeting the deltoid muscles, especially the front (anterior)
deltoids, while also engaging the upper chest (pectorals), triceps, and upper back (trapezius) . Stand
with a barbell (or dumbbells) at shoulder height and grip just wider than shoulders. Brace your core and
press the weight overhead until arms are fully extended . Keep your back straight and avoid arching
as you push up. Lower the weight back to shoulder level with control. This movement builds shoulder
and arm strength and requires core stabilization .
Bicep Curl – A classic arm exercise that isolates the biceps (front of the upper arm) while also engaging
the forearm muscles. It works the biceps brachii and the brachialis/brachioradialis in the forearm .
To perform, stand holding a dumbbell (or barbell) in each hand at your sides with palms facing forward.
Keeping elbows close to the torso, exhale and bend your elbows to curl the weights up toward your
shoulders . Squeeze the biceps at the top, then lower the weights slowly back to start. Proper form
means upper arms stay stationary and only the forearms move .
Bent-Over Row – A compound back exercise that primarily targets the middle and upper back muscles
(latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, middle trapezius) and the rear shoulders, while also involving the biceps
and core for stability . Stand with feet shoulder-width under a barbell, hinge forward at the hips with
a flat back (torso ~45° to floor) . Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip just outside your knees. Pull
the barbell upward toward your lower chest by retracting your shoulder blades and bending your
elbows back . Lower it back down under control. This builds back and arm strength while keeping
the spine stabilized.
Leg Press – A machine exercise targeting the major leg muscles: the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes,
calves, and hip adductors . Sit on the leg press machine with your back supported and place your
feet flat on the footplate about hip-width apart. Push the plate away by extending your knees and hips
until legs are nearly straight (without locking knees) . Then slowly bend your knees to return the
plate to the start position. This machine allows heavy loading of the legs and glutes with added support
from the seat .
Lat Pulldown – A cable machine exercise for the upper back. It primarily targets the latissimus dorsi
muscles (back), and also works the biceps, shoulders, and upper chest . Sit at the lat pulldown
station, grasp the bar overhead with a wide grip, and pull the bar down toward your upper chest by
pulling your elbows down and back . Keep your torso upright or slightly reclined and avoid leaning
back excessively. Slowly let the bar rise back up under control. This mimics a pull-up and strengthens
the back and arms .
Chest Press Machine – A seated machine variation of the bench press targeting the same muscles:
primarily the chest (pectoralis major), anterior shoulders (deltoids), and triceps . Sit upright in the
machine with back against the pad and grip the handles at chest height. Push the handles forward by
extending your arms until elbows are nearly locked, then slowly return to start. Keep shoulders down
and core braced. The machine guides the motion, allowing you to focus on pressing the weight with
proper form .
Seated Cable Row – A cable machine exercise that works the muscles of the middle back. It targets the
latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius, and also engages the biceps and forearms . Sit with
knees slightly bent and feet braced, grasp the cable handle, and keep your back straight. Pull the
handle toward your abdomen by driving elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together .
Pause, then extend the arms back out under control. This builds back and arm strength while the core
stabilizes your posture .
Leg Extension – A machine exercise that isolates the quadriceps (front thigh) muscles . Sit on a leg
extension machine with the padded lever against your shins and legs bent. Lift the lever by extending
your knees until legs are almost straight (without locking the knees) . Then lower back down slowly.
This movement focuses on the quadriceps (rectus femoris and vastus muscles) and is often used to
strengthen the knee extensors .
Leg Curl – A machine exercise (seated or lying) that targets the hamstrings (back of thigh) . For the
seated leg curl, sit with the padded lever on the back of your lower legs. Curl your legs by bending your
knees, bringing your heels toward your buttocks . Keep your thighs in contact with the bench. Slowly
straighten the legs to return. This isolates and strengthens the hamstrings, and typically also lightly
involves the calves .
Downward Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) – A foundational yoga pose that stretches and strengthens
multiple muscle groups. It stretches the hamstrings, calves, and shoulders, while the arms and
shoulders (deltoids and triceps) and core (including the obliques) bear weight and strengthen to hold
the pose . To do it, start on all fours, then lift your hips up and back, straightening your legs as
much as comfortable and pressing your heels toward the floor. Your body forms an inverted “V” shape.
Hold and breathe deeply, pressing into your hands and engaging your core. This lengthens the spine
and legs and builds shoulder and core stability .
Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I) – A standing lunge yoga pose that strengthens the legs and core while
opening the hips and chest . It engages the front leg’s quadriceps and hamstrings to stabilize the
bent knee and the back leg’s hip flexors, with both glute muscles stabilizing the pelvis. The core
(transverse abdominis) and lower back muscles hold the spine erect, and the arms and shoulders raise
overhead to open the chest . To do it, step one foot back and bend the front knee over the ankle
(around 90°), keeping the back leg straight and pelvis tucked under. Raise your arms overhead, keeping
the shoulders relaxed. Maintain an upright torso. This pose builds lower-body strength, balance, and
hip flexibility .
Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) – A prone back-bending yoga pose that strengthens the spine and upper
back. It activates the erector spinae along the spine as well as the rhomboids and lower trapezius
(upper back muscles), while stretching the chest (pectorals) and abdominals . To perform cobra, lie
face down with legs extended and hands under your shoulders. Engage your back muscles and press
into your hands to lift your chest off the floor, straightening the arms (full cobra) or keeping elbows bent
(half cobra) . Keep your hips on the ground and lengthen your neck. This builds strength in the back
and stretches the front body .
Tree Pose (Vrksasana) – A standing balance pose that strengthens the legs, glutes, core, and back while
improving stability . Stand on one leg and press the sole of your opposite foot into the inner thigh or
calf of the standing leg, bringing hands to prayer position or overhead. This challenges the ankle, calf,
and quadriceps of the standing leg to stabilize you, while engaging the standing-leg glute and hip
muscles . Your core and back muscles must also engage to keep your torso tall and balanced .
Find a steady gaze forward to help balance. This pose builds strength in the supporting leg and core
while improving focus and posture .
Child’s Pose (Balasana) – A restful forward-fold yoga pose that gently stretches the back, hips, and
shoulders . Kneel and sit back on your heels, then fold your torso forward over your thighs,
extending your arms in front or resting them by your sides. Lower your forehead to the mat. This
position lengthens the spine and stretches the muscles of the lower back and neck. It also stretches the
shoulders (trapezius), hip flexors, thighs (quadriceps), glutes, and side torso (obliques) . Breathe
deeply and relax in this posture. It relieves tension and improves flexibility in the back and hips.
Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana) – A back-extension yoga pose that opens the chest and
strengthens the posterior chain. Lying on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, press
through your feet to lift your hips toward the ceiling . This action strengthens the gluteal muscles
and hamstrings while engaging the quadriceps. The pose also stretches the chest, shoulders, and
abdomen . Keep the shoulders grounded and interlace your fingers under your back if possible.
Holding the lift strengthens the lower back and legs and improves spinal flexibility .
Pilates Hundred – A classic Pilates mat exercise that builds core endurance. It targets the abdominal
muscles (especially the transverse abdominis and rectus abdominis) . To do it, lie on your back in a
comfortable curl-up with head and shoulders lifted, legs extended (either bent or straight). Pump your
arms up and down vigorously while taking five short inhales and five short exhales (counting to 100
total breaths). Keep your lower back pressed to the mat and ribs down. This challenges the core to
stabilize the spine while coordinating deep breathing .
Pilates Roll-Up – A controlled Pilates exercise that mobilizes the spine and strengthens the abdominals
. Lie flat with legs straight and arms extended overhead. Inhale as you tuck your chin and curl the
spine up, reaching toward your toes. Exhale and continue to roll up, vertebra by vertebra, until you
touch your feet (keeping legs straight). Then inhale as you reverse the motion, articulating the spine
back down slowly to the floor . Keep the hips grounded. This movement works the entire abdominal
wall and increases spinal flexibility .
Leg Circles (One-Leg Circle) – A Pilates mat exercise strengthening the hips and core. Lying on your back
with one leg extended up toward the ceiling and the other leg grounded, you move the raised leg in
controlled circles. This exercise targets the glutes (especially the hip abductors) and hip flexors, while
also engaging the abdominal muscles to stabilize the pelvis . Keep your shoulders and back flat on
the mat. Circling the leg challenges the glutes and core to maintain alignment and builds hip stability
.
Jumping Jacks – A dynamic bodyweight cardio exercise that works the entire body . Begin standing,
then jump your feet out to about shoulder-width apart as you raise your arms overhead, and
immediately jump back to the start position with feet together and arms at your sides. This continuous
jumping movement raises the heart rate. It engages the leg muscles (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes,
calves) as well as shoulders and core to coordinate the arm movement . Jumping jacks improve
aerobic fitness and power.
Burpees – A high-intensity full-body exercise combining a squat, plank, push-up, and jump . From
standing, squat down and place hands on the floor, kick your feet back into a plank, perform a push-up
(chest to floor), then jump your feet back toward your hands and explode upward into a jump. This
complex move engages the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, chest, shoulders, arms, and core . It
dramatically raises heart rate and builds both strength and cardiovascular endurance.
Cycling – A cardiovascular exercise that primarily works the leg muscles . Riding a bike (stationary or
outdoor) uses the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles for the pedal stroke, while the calves
assist with each pedal’s downstroke . The abdominals and lower back (erector spinae) also engage to
stabilize the torso as you ride. Cycling at a steady pace or interval style builds leg endurance and
cardiovascular fitness.
Running – A fundamental cardio exercise for endurance. It predominantly uses the lower-body muscles:
quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, with significant involvement from the calves . Core muscles and
upper legs stabilize your stride. To run properly, maintain an upright posture and a steady pace or
interval bursts. Running strengthens the legs and lungs, increases heart rate, and improves overall
stamina .
Jump Rope – A cardio jump exercise that primarily targets the legs (calves, quadriceps, hamstrings) and
also works the core (abdominals) plus the arms and back . Stand with a rope held in both hands at
hip level. Swing the rope over your head by rotating the wrists and jump over it as it passes under your
feet. Keep knees slightly bent and land softly on the balls of your feet. This continuous jumping
movement elevates heart rate, burns calories, and builds lower-body and core endurance .
Mountain Climbers – A dynamic bodyweight exercise that combines cardio with core and upper-body
strength . Start in a high plank position. Keeping your core tight, quickly drive one knee toward your
chest and then switch legs, alternating as if “running” in place. The plank position engages the
shoulders, triceps, chest, and serratus anterior to support your body, while the legs (glutes, quadriceps,
hip flexors, hamstrings, calves) power the alternating knee drives . This full-body move raises your
heart rate and builds core stability.
High Knees – A cardio warm-up exercise that works the hip flexors and leg muscles. Stand tall and run in
place by driving the knees up toward waist level or higher . This motion primarily engages the
quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves (legs), while also involving the abs and glutes to stabilize the hips
. Pump your arms as you lift the knees. High knees raise the heart rate quickly and improve hip
flexor strength, leg power, and cardiovascular endurance
